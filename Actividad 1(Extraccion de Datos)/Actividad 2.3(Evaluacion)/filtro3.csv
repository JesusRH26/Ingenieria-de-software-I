I came from the beautiful Finger Lakes area in upstate New York, moving here at 18 years old because I ""had never known until I came to Colorado that the sun could come out in winter. ""  That being the case, of course I never left. Lynne is from Colorado, with great-grandparents who grew up in Georgetown and old Snowmass. Life back then was not glamorous and a living was cobbled together from gritty pursuits such as silver mining.  
We love beautiful spaces, the outdoors, art in its many forms, and the company of good friends.  One of our careers together has been restoring neglected historic homes, and our home has been an almost two-decades long work in progress.  Restoring the apartment was one of our earlier efforts, and as is usually the case, we found architectural clues as to what our home's earlier owners had been up to.  (Such as the enormous beams that proved the claim that our house had been moved from Denver Municipal Airport in 1928. That airport became the old Stapleton Airport. We also heard from a gentleman in his ninties that he had watched it being moved.)
We believe historic homes are living history, in real time.  Having modern amenities makes them all the more appealing.
Possibly our greatest love is travel.  We agree with St. Gus, who said ""The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page."" And of course our favorite part of traveling is and always will be connecting with people from all walks of life, from all around the world. We're so thankful to have the opportunity to do this once more through hosting.

My name is Alexandre. I am a spirited and adventurous documentary filmmaker and comic book writer, originally from Geneva, Switzerland. My last three films -- ""78/52: Hitchcock's Shower Scene"" ; ""Memory: The Origins of Alien"" ; and ""Leap of Faith: William Friedkin on The Exorcist"" -- premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2017, 2019, and 2020, respectively. 78/52 is now available on Hulu and Blu Ray/DVD; and Memory is also available on Blu Ray/DVD and on most digital platforms. Leap of Faith is currently streaming on Shudder. My latest film, Lynch/Oz, just premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in June!

I'm currently working on several exciting feature projects, and always traveling as a result. This is why I choose to make my home available to fellow travelers. I am driven by mindfulness, integrity, kindness, empathy, childlike curiosity, an endless fascination for this extraordinary world we live in, and a passion for creative expression. 

If you like watching docs, you may have come across some of my other titles on Netflix or Hulu: The People vs. George Lucas, Doc of the Dead, The Life and Times of Paul the Psychic Octopus, etc. 

I have lived in Switzerland, France, England (Dorset, to be exact), Zimbabwe (Harare), San Diego, San Francisco, NYC (college years), and now Denver. I’m crazy about Northern California, the Pacific Northwest, and New Zealand... and will probably be visiting one of said places while you're enjoying my loft! ;)

I'm a huge movie buff, and my new loft has just been fully upgraded with a state-of-the-art LG C1 OLED 77"" screen with Sonos sound bar! So you'll have your own mini movie theater right inside your home away from home!

Favorite filmmakers: David Lynch, William Wyler, Alfred Hitchcock, Mikio Naruse, Akira Kurosawa, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Sergio Leone, Ingmar Bergman, Wes Anderson, Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, Orson Welles, John Huston, Josef von Sternberg, Michelangelo Antonioni, P.T. Anderson, Joel & Ethan Coen... okay, I'm going to stop here.

Films I couldn't do without: Vertigo, Strangers on a Train, Psycho, Mulholland Drive, Seven Samurai, Rushmore, Woman in the Dunes, The Shining, Citizen Kane, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Blade Runner, Star Wars, The Big Sleep, The Killing, Nosferatu, Fargo, and...
