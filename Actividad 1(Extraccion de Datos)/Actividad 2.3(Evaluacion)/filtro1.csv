We're excited to introduce you to this exceptional property and the vibrant neighborhood it calls home. <br /><br />La Alma Lincoln Park is not only one of Denver’s oldest residential neighborhoods, with a rare concentration of homes built before 1890, but it was also at the heart of Denver’s Chicano Movement, or El Movimiento, in the 1960s and 1970s. The neighborhood demonstrates the close connection between place and people, made tangible by the surviving structures set close together — diverse in their architectural styles yet maintaining a consistent pattern for 150 years. We invite you to explore the streets of your historic neighborhood.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-976035678830893136/original/16249d88-1eb9-4d11-83b6-1f701a30d302.jpeg,51632806,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/51632806,Jason,2015-12-18,"Denver, CO",,within an hour,100%,97%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-51632806/original/52c7a365-2ea1-42c2-a56d-b1cdb2f3622d.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User-51632806/original/52c7a365-2ea1-42c2-a56d-b1cdb2f3622d.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Lincoln Park,1,1,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,Neighborhood highlights,Lincoln Park,,39.7310106,-105.0039318,Entire guest suite,Entire home/apt,2,1.0,1 bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Mini fridge"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Iron"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Keypad"", ""Clothing storage: dresser"", ""32 inch HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, Roku"", ""Central heating"", ""Hangers"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Self check-in"", ""Mini fridge with freezer refrigerator"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Shower gel"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Zero Derm Fragrance Free conditioner"", ""Essentials"", ""Coffee"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Zero Derm Fragrance Free body soap"", ""Zero Derm Fragrance Free shampoo"", ""Freezer"", ""Free street parking"", ""Bed linens"", ""Bidet"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Central air conditioning"", ""Portable heater"", ""Single level home"", ""Private entrance"", ""Wifi"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Hot water"", ""Portable fans""]",$122.00,2,60,1,2,60,60,2.0,60.0,,t,11,41,71,250,2024-09-29,76,76,5,2023-10-15,2024-09-24,4.99,4.99,4.99,4.96,5.0,4.7,4.96,2023-BFN-0033290,f,1,1,0,0,6.5
