HOW HOSTING BECAME OUR PASSION:
Tim and I came into our relationship each owning a 2 bedroom house.  As our family grew and our needs changed, we decided to rent out both of our two homes because neither one of us wanted to sell. We gave short term renting a try and we’ve had such great experiences with the wonderful people we’ve met. It brings joy to know that our guests are enjoying our homes as much as we did. 

As a couple who travels quite a bit, we try to incorporate a high level of standards of what we expect in a hotel.

I'm a 5th generation Denver native with roots and pride in my place.  I love welcoming people to the Mile High City and putting our best foot forward by hosting my home.  In July 2020 I also become owner and proprietor of a very cool property in Western Colorado currently hosting three tiny homes.

Before COVID I spent several long stretches of the year working as a Tour Director.  I lead small groups on wonderful vacations like ""Italy's Great Cities,"" or the ""Best of Spain."" I also lead student groups to DC and NYC, and birthright tours to Israel.

Long term travel is in my system.  I've spent years at a time in Morocco for the US Peace Corps and more years in each of Japan, Israel and Costa Rica working mostly as an English teacher and basketball coach.

Between the really long living abroad situations, I tried to see as much as I could see.  From the top bunk of a crowded boxcar on the Trans-Siberian Railway, to five-star hotels in Jerusalem I stayed everywhere.  Seeing the best and worst of accommodations, I learned to love the hospitality game.  

In 2014 I returned to Denver to became a family caregiver.  I began hosting a small family owned condo in Denver.  That little condo kept my pockets jingling and my mind spinning for four years.  So many problems!  Floods and bugs and drugs, Oh my!

But I worked that little listing, and I leveraged my hard-knock education into SuperHost status.  When it came time to trade up, I sold the condo and found this wonderful house in Denver.  I selected it specifically because I recognized its versatility as an AirBnB property.  

This home will forever be a work in progress.  It will never be perfect.  But it may be perfect for you!  I am an individual home owner and not a large conglomerate or property management company.  I'm working to improve and integrate new technology including dynamic pricing, limited automated messaging, and streamlining all my cleaning processes.

Would love to have you see these little passion projects of mine.  Speak to you soon!

A close friend was undergoing medical treatments, and because we did not have a lot of money, we decided to rent out our house (and stay on his couch) for the weekend of a now famous music festival. 

The weekend was a huge success, the guests had an amazing time, we made new friends, and our friend got the money for his medical treatment. After that we were hooked!

Since 2015, we have lived the goodness everyday that hosting people can generate. We have now hosted thousands of visitors in properties around the country that we either own renovated and manage, or have helped others renovate and/or manage.

Our family works extremely hard to provide our guests a luxury experience (at a price point for everyone) by combining perfect accommodations, unrivaled service plus concierge access to the local area. 

We love hosting weekend getaways, large groups for Bachelor/Bachelorette parties, extended stays for traveling professionals. Anyone with goodness in their heart are always welcome at any of our homes.

We have a small staff that helps answer any question 24/7, but we're a very small family company with a passion for providing an incredible guest experience.

We look forward to hosting you!

I moved down to Chicago to attend DePaul University and spent about 14 years there.  My wife and I decided we needed a change and moved to Denver the summer of 2016 after a 6 week roadtrip across America.  I love going to see live music; I enjoy pretty much all types of music, but specifically blue grass, jam bands, rap/hip hop and electronica.  I try and bike as much as possible, so it has allowed me go around the city and visit all of the different neighborhoods.  I am also a Chicago sports fan and love to cheer on the Bears, Hawks, Bulls & Sox.  However, if there is any type of sporting event on, I am always down to watch. 

I am Nicole, originally from Ohio and moved to Chicago in the fall of 2010 where I met Ryan.  After almost 6 years there, we were excited to move to Denver together the summer of 2016.  I enjoy exploring the different neighborhoods and the restaurants, bars and shops within them.  I strive to live a natural and green lifestyle by making my own cleaning products and eating healthier at home.  I enjoy finding new recipes and trying them out.  I also love travelling and learning about new places and their cultures.  When I travel, I like to try to find the hidden, ""untouristy"" spots, which is why Airbnb is perfect for me!  I also enjoy live music and checking out new bands at different venues throughout the city with Ryan!!

Ryan and I thoroughly enjoy hosting.  We love getting to know our guests and including them in our summer bbqs, dinners and/or visits to the bars.  We are very much in love with our Catahoula dog named Bunches.  He is a very sweet dog who loves children and any kind of attention he can get.  He is a mellow dog who is potty trained and would love to meet you!  We also hope to meet you and show off our beautiful city!

I unexpectedly ended up staying 12 years, earning a masters degree in urban planning from SJSU, launching a nonprofit called Garden to Table that focused on local food system development, and helping launch a company called Public Space Authority that focused on developing, programming, and studying public spaces. I also became a master gardener in California during this time, and have since completed the course in Colorado as well - each property reflects this knowledge and will always be adding more plants to the landscape. In 2020, I left my job as COO of a successful company to take care of my 2 kids, and we decided to move our family to Denver, CO to focus on raising our kids with our closest friends. After 9 years of saving money living in a tiny home (<700 sq ft) with 2 kids and dog, we finally took the plunge and bought our home in Denver with a rental property in the back, and a small house in Saint Augustine, FL, which is our home base for staying connected to our Florida family - where all our parents, siblings, and the vast majority of our extended family live. Prior to setting up our own Airbnbs, we used the platform extensively, traveling all over the country and many parts of the world. Being on the hosting side has been a real treat - as we have been able to take all the experiences we have had over many years of travel and put them in both of our rentals, which we are constantly tinkering with and improving. If you come back again, you will notice little touches inside and out. We are constantly working to improve the things we can control.

We bought our house in July of 2021 as somewhat of a fixer upper but saw it as a place we could grow and mold into something that's our own. Over the following year we painstakingly renovated the house to create the Airbnb. 

We married in August 2021 and had our wedding reception in a giant 20x40 foot wood framed tent where the fenced in yard area is. The barrel cocktail tables were later halved and used as the Aspen tree planter boxes.  The actual ceremony was held at a mining parcel we bought specifically for the ceremony.  It's precariously perched on the side of a mountain with views of the continental divide near Empire, Colorado. The wood for the bookshelves come from a ~120 year old sluice box, which was used to sift out gold from gravel, we found on our mining parcel.

Danny grew up in a military affiliated family in Germany and spent his formative years creating memories traveling as a family through Europe. He always wanted to work in hospitality so he could help families and friends create new memories through traveling. Today, Danny works from home as software developer for the U.S. Geological Survey. 

CJ grew up in Montana skiing and training horses. CJ loves bringing people together around food and a good movie. CJ works as a Physician Associate(PA) in urgent care.

In our free time we enjoy skiing, hiking, camping, playing with our dogs and traveling the world.

We now live in both Jersey AND L.A. -- and often Atlanta due to Cindy's work.  We like to say we are bi-coastal (sounds impressive, doesn't it?  ha-ha) When we are both out of Cali for work , we list our Silver Lake apartment on Airbnb.   The Salty V at the Shore is so big, it seemed a waste not to share, so we are listing rooms this summer for the first time.   

We love hosting our Airbnb travelers and knowing our home is well taken care of.  We are going on our 7th year as hosts and it's been a great experience.   
For some reason, we love living in tourist locations. Maybe its because we love hosting friends and family- including our AirBnb family-- as well as exploring the places around us.  OK, we moved to the Jersey Shore for the beach and the food-- there, we said it.  Oh- and we love to gamble. Yeah, that too.  Nothing beats L.A., tho, for the weather and the chill vibe- even in traffic. We love it there too.

We have two fur babies- Nina, our Chi mix, barks too much protecting the perimeter--we are working on that. You can never meet a more friendly dog, tho.  She is the darling of the dog beach.  Our kitty cat Harper Lee is one big sweetie, but shy. You won't see her around much. 

Pat likes to cook and host and hold babies- a natural caretaker.  She also loves the outdoors: camping, swimming, hiking and gardening.  She volunteers when she can-- for animals, people and political causes-tho we won't say which ones :o) 

Cindy,  loves everything about LA, especially the Dodgers.  She has a great deal of knowledge about the city and would be happy to pass along any information to help our guests enjoy their stay there. Cindy works as a TV/Film editor and loves watching TV and going to the movies, of course! 

We are a team, but Pat is usually the one you will talk to when you contact us, and Cindy is the city info expert and technical adviser (if you need to know how to work the remotes, tee-hee).  We are both a phone call or text away for anything you might need (including emergency toilet paper.) Yikes!

We now live in both Jersey AND L.A. -- and often Atlanta due to Cindy's work.  We like to say we are bi-coastal (sounds impressive, doesn't it?  ha-ha) When we are both out of Cali for work , we list our Silver Lake apartment on Airbnb.   The Salty V at the Shore is so big, it seemed a waste not to share, so we are listing rooms this summer for the first time.   

We love hosting our Airbnb travelers and knowing our home is well taken care of.  We are going on our 7th year as hosts and it's been a great experience.   
For some reason, we love living in tourist locations. Maybe its because we love hosting friends and family- including our AirBnb family-- as well as exploring the places around us.  OK, we moved to the Jersey Shore for the beach and the food-- there, we said it.  Oh- and we love to gamble. Yeah, that too.  Nothing beats L.A., tho, for the weather and the chill vibe- even in traffic. We love it there too.

We have two fur babies- Nina, our Chi mix, barks too much protecting the perimeter--we are working on that. You can never meet a more friendly dog, tho.  She is the darling of the dog beach.  Our kitty cat Harper Lee is one big sweetie, but shy. You won't see her around much. 

Pat likes to cook and host and hold babies- a natural caretaker.  She also loves the outdoors: camping, swimming, hiking and gardening.  She volunteers when she can-- for animals, people and political causes-tho we won't say which ones :o) 

Cindy,  loves everything about LA, especially the Dodgers.  She has a great deal of knowledge about the city and would be happy to pass along any information to help our guests enjoy their stay there. Cindy works as a TV/Film editor and loves watching TV and going to the movies, of course! 

We are a team, but Pat is usually the one you will talk to when you contact us, and Cindy is the city info expert and technical adviser (if you need to know how to work the remotes, tee-hee).  We are both a phone call or text away for anything you might need (including emergency toilet paper.) Yikes!
